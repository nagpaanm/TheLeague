# TheLeague
TheLeague is a GUI-based 'NBA statistical database' that I developed using Java and JavaFX.

It allows you to search up any current NBA basketball player, and fetches statistical information and pictures of that respective player. It makes use of the 'JSOUP' library to parse the internet and retrieve this information (no data is actually stored on the application itself).
